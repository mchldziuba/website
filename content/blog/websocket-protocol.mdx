# Painful process
Websocket protocol was harder to implement than I initially thought. I learned a lot about networking and dealing with bitwise operations. Although my implementation is not perfect, it can even handle larger files (like images or videos).

# Two main challenges
Handling large WS frames is hard because we have to deal with frame fragmentation over TCP data stream. Second major challenge is parsing WS frame.
